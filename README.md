- __How these features support the User Stories__

    - The User Stories in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) part of this document are numbered and categorised into groups A (first time visitor), B (returning visitor) and C (frequent visitor).  The existing features are listed above as F01 to F08.  Below is a traceability matrix cross-referencing the user stories with the features, illustrating which features support which stories :

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Store user scores__
    - Currently the user is asked to enter a username but that is only used to display the name on screen.  Functionality could be added to upload results for that user to a website so it could be compared against other player results or the user could use it to try to beat their own high-score.

- __Extend Topic selection functionality__
    - A maximum of 4 topic titles are listed on the topics screen.  Functionality could be added so that if more than 4 titles were available in the quiz data structure then either a random selection of 4 titles could be picked, or all available titles could be presented to the user to choose from.
